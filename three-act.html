       <h1 class="head">Three Act</h1>
   </header>
   <h2 class="a">First Act</h2>
   <p>Used to establish the world, the setting, and characters. In a sense, used for exposition and setting up the main conflict of the story. Early on, ideally right away, there should be a narrative or visual hook to entice the viewer to continue viewing. By the end of the first act, the protagonist will have to confront the conflict, and will have to decide how to proceed forward. This is usually an event that forces the protagonist to change.</p>
   <h2 class="b">Second Act</h2>
   <p>Rising action, in two words. This is where the protagonist undergoes change in order to resolve the conflict. This doesnâ€™t have to be a physical change, but can be spiritual or inner change as well. In fewer words, this part is used for character development. Here the character discovers ultimately what they must do, and begins working towards it. By the end of the act, the stakes will have risen to their maximum point, and things will come to a head.</p>
   <h2 class="c">Third Act</h2>
   <p>The resolution, where questions are answered, conflict resolved. The final confrontation occurs here, where opposing forces conclude their struggle. The premise from the first act here is achieved. At the end, loose threads must find resolution, and questions should be answered.</p>

   <h2 class="d">Techniques</h2>
   <p>Every film major student should know some basic knowledge about the techniques that professional movie makers use. In this section we will give you some information about basic techniques that you have to know in order to make a movie. These techniques divide into different parts, first technique that is really important is camera techniques. There are different type of camera techniques like over the shoulder technique, zoom shot, track in shots and etc. 
Beside camera angle techniques, lighting technique is also important, you should be able to mix color temperatures and also know about soft light and  hot backlight. In order to use the soft light and hot backlight techniques, you need to have a soft light source in front and a strong light source from the back.
When it comes to movies, sounds and audios are also important factors. You have to be able to choose a music that fits your movie. You should also need to know the difference between diegetic and non diegetic sounds. Diegetic sound is the type of sound that both audience and characters can hear but Non diegetic sound is the type of sound that only audience can hear.
