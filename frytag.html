            <h2>Action: Redline</h2>
            <p>Redline, directed by Takeshi Koike, is certainly a front runner for most adrenaline-packed films out there. There are many elements contributing to this title, inherent to its animated format, which would be either impossible or prohibitively impractical in a live action format. The setting of a race in an interstellar warzone planet with a panoply of alien races with a wild array of insanely absurd visuals has so many adjectives crammed in that a live action film simply couldn’t give the vision justice. Frequent use of exaggerated perspective would be nearly impossible to capture without breaking suspension of disbelief in live action as well. The absolute bombast of the film is further reinforced by its sumptuous visual style. Redline takes cues from film noir by using solid black for shading, giving it a strong sense of chiaroscuro. This causes everything to pop out. Lastly, but certainly one of the strongest elements of the film is the soundtrack by James Shimoji. A high octane thumping base-line punctuated by a relentless electronic beat accelerates the heart rate just on its own. Paired with the fact paced, and bold visuals, you get a recipe for an adrenaline dump like no other.

            <h2>Drama:  Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</h2>
            <p>These days when someone says spy movies, they think, exotic locations, characters, and a bit of bombast. They forget that the world of spies is a subtle thing, waged unnoticed. You do that by withholding information, and parcel it out in a very calculated manner. The truth and trust is a nebulous thing. In a sense, the reason that Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, and many other spy movies are much like a mystery novel. Spies must deal with ever-present uncertainty, and as an audience, we must feel that sense of paranoia and uncertainty as well. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy succeeds and goes a step further by inundating the audience in the world of espionage, unapologetically throwing arcane terms and catchphrases. We are drawn into the patient, purposeful world of spies in a slow-burn hunt, keeping tensions high the whole way. Uncertainty and mistrust are the bywords of spycraft, and that is how Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy keeps us on the edge.</p>

            <h2>Comedy: Blazing Saddles</h2>
            <p>Mel Brooks signature comedy is built around low-brow humor, done with sophistication. He takes what we’ve come to expect out of a much beloved trope or genre, and turns it around on its head. Playing with our expectations is a core concept of good comedy, and Blazing Saddles goes that extra distance by playing with timing. You can get good results by delivering the punchline on the beat, but delay it half a beat after a rapid fire series of hijinks? He is also not afraid to serve as a jester, bluntly approaching offensive topics. In Blazing Saddles, it is racism. Yet for all its brashness, the film can’t be described as having bad taste. It’s because the racism was baked into the story as an integral part. It’s a commentary not on just the society of that time, but the current one as well.</p>
